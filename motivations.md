I am mostly motivated to change my career for fulfillment. I had previously worked
in financial sales for 7 years. Although the money was good it gave me no
fulfillment. I feel most fulfilled when I am learning new things and expanding
my knowledge. Constant need for growth and learning is what drove me to
Computer Science.
